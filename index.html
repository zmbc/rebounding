      <h3>Visual Encodings</h3>
      <p>
        Rebounding falls into two major categories, offensive and defensive, so
        I chose measures of those two categories for the two position encodings
        (specifically <abbr title="Percentage of possible offensive rebounds the player got">ORB%</abbr>
        and <abbr title="Percentage of possible defensive rebounds the player got">DRB%</abbr>).
        Since the two are correlated, these two position encodings create
        a direction encoding that shows the strength of the correlation. There is
        also somewhat of a phantom length encoding: a player's diagonal distance from the
        imaginary trendline represents the extent to which that player is more
        offensive-rebounding focused or defensive-rebounding focused (for example,
        Kevin Durant sticks out as a particularly defensive-rebounding focused
        forward).
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, the expressiveness of this visualization is impacted by
        occlusion. The use of a lowered opacity mostly mitigates this problem,
        but the guards of the NBA are so similar in their (lack of) rebounding
        that they can't be separated when viewed alongside forwards and centers.
        This reduces the ability to ask specific questions about them, but they
        still contribute to the overall direction encoding.
      </p>
      <h3>Control Elements</h3>
      <h4>Color Encoding</h4>
      <p>
        The purpose of the color encoding is to make comparisons between colors, not
        to look for patterns within colored groups (that's what filtering is for).
        Looking at the rebounding data, the two comparisons I was most curious about
        were between positions and between "eras" (approximated here by
        <abbr title="1982-83 during the 'Bird and Magic era,' 1994-95 during the 'MJ/90s era,' and 2016-17 during the modern era">three selected seasons</abbr>).
        For this reason, the user can choose which of these is encoded as color.
      </p>
      <h4>Season &amp; Position Filter</h4>
      <p>
        Because the color encoding can be either one of these, they both serve the
        same two purposes:
        <ul>
          <li>
            When they're not the color encoding, the filters act as a way to
            scope the comparison. Instead of comparing guards to forwards overall,
            for instance, the season filter allows a user to compare guards to
            forwards only in the 2016-17 season.
          </li>
          <li>
            When they are the color encoding, the filters allow point-to-point
            comparison between any two items. For instance, instead of looking
            at the overall difference between positions, the position filter
            allows a user to compare forwards to centers specifically.
          </li>
        </ul>
        A few discoveries I made using these filters:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Comparing guards across the seasons, it seems that modern guards
            are significantly more defensive-rebounding focused than guards of
            the past (even without outlier Russell Westbrook, though he is an
            extreme example of this). The same trend looks to be somewhat true
            of other positions, but the effect is far larger on guards.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the 1994-95 season, forwards and centers are pretty indistinguishable
            among the best rebounders (again, this is even true when excluding
            the outlier Dennis Rodman). There were plenty of forwards who didn't
            rebound well in that season, but the best forwards were just as good as
            or better than centers. In other seasons, while there is considerable
            overlap, the top rebounders are mostly centers.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h4>Usage Filter</h4>
      <p>
        Although rebounding is interesting on its own, I also wanted users to be
        able to filter by a non-rebounding-related factor. I chose
        <abbr title="Percentage of plays 'used' (e.g. by shooting or turning over the ball) by a player while they're on the floor">usage percentage</abbr>
        because it measures the amount of non-rebounding "work" the player has to do,
        as well as being a good proxy for star-ness (set the minimum usage to 28%
        and an NBA fan will recognize nearly all of the names).
      </p>
      <p>
        At a first glance at the data, it's easy to dismiss Russell Westbrook's
        rebounding (and by extension his <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/westbru01.html">triple-double average</a>)
        as a meaningless artifact due to the highly unusual defensive-to-offensive rebounding ratio.
        However, when the minimum usage is set to 25%, it becomes clear that
        for a guard with superstar levels of offensive workload, Westbrook's
        <strong>offensive</strong> rebounding rate is also one of the best of
        all time.
